## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Calendar Data
- We access your **Google Calendar events** only after you authenticate via Google OAuth.  
- Events include: title, date, time, and metadata required for app functionality.  
- Data is stored **locally on your device** for offline use.  
- **We do not store calendar data on our servers.**

### 1.2 Push Notifications
- Selected event metadata (event ID, start/end time) is sent to **Firebase** to deliver push notifications and update Live Activities.  
- Firebase stores only the information necessary for delivering notifications.

### 1.3 Analytics
- We use **PostHog** (EU-hosted) to collect **anonymous usage data**, such as screen views, feature usage, and app launches.  
- No personal identifiers (name, email, device ID) are sent to PostHog.  
- This data is used to improve the app and understand usage patterns.

### 1.4 Diagnostics
- Crash and performance data may be collected through Firebase Crashlytics for debugging and improving the app.  
- No personal identifiers are included unless you explicitly provide them (e.g., via support requests).
